chb 3, 12, 13, 16:
features selected using forward sequentialfs, w/o specifying nFeatures, without cross-validation, and (03*spec+0.7*sens) as a criterion
normalization
balancing (-ve class is almost twice the +ve class)
partitionaing using dataPartition()
rbf kernel
classification with function
RESULTS: it took about 4 days to run sequentialfs. the selected features were all except for
	5 (skewness), 10 (min absolute), and 13 (variartion coeff).
	accuracy -> 74.87	74.77
	Sensitivity -> 75.57	78.01
	Specificity -> 74.596	73.49
Conclusion: it's not worth using sequrntialfs instead of t-test. 
	it takes alot of time without much improving the results.
